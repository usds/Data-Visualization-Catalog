#### Description

<p> A Sparkline is a small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no longer cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but rather sparkline graphics can be everywhere a word or number can be: embedded in a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet, graphic. A Column Sparkline is basically same as the classic sparkline, except that it uses columns/bars instead of lines.


#### Function: Comparison / Trend over time

<p>In a nutshell, a comparison chart provides a visual representation of various options that can be compared to each other. It can have their pros, cons, key features, etc. that would depict vital differences between these entities (or choices). Since there is no rule of thumb with comparison charts, they can depict both quantitative and qualitative characteristics. Mostly, comparison charts are easy to make and can help us in educational purposes or to make data-driven decisions.

Displaying data over time increases understanding of the real performance of a process, particularly with regard to an established target or goal.
